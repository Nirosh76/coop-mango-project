    <h1>Tree Planting and Growth Monitoring Activities</h1>
    <p>This document outlines a comprehensive list of activities related to tree planting, monitoring growth, fertilizing, disease management, and harvesting. Each activity is described in detail to provide a clear understanding of the processes involved in successful tree cultivation.</p>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h2>1. Tree Planting</h2>
        <p>Tree planting involves selecting appropriate species for the local environment, preparing the site, and planting saplings. This activity includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Site Selection:</strong> Choosing a suitable location based on soil type, sunlight, and water availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Clearing the area of weeds and debris, and loosening the soil to promote root growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Digging holes for saplings, ensuring proper spacing, and planting at the correct depth.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h2>2. Monitoring Growth of Trees</h2>
        <p>Monitoring the growth of trees is essential to ensure they are developing healthily. This activity includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Measurements:</strong> Measuring height and trunk diameter at regular intervals to track growth rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Inspections:</strong> Checking for signs of stress, such as wilting leaves or discoloration.</li>
            <li><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> Maintaining a growth log to document changes and identify trends over time.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h2>3. Fertilizing</h2>
        <p>Fertilizing is crucial for providing trees with the necessary nutrients for healthy growth. This activity includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soil Testing:</strong> Analyzing soil samples to determine nutrient deficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Choosing Fertilizers:</strong> Selecting appropriate fertilizers based on soil test results and tree species requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Application:</strong> Applying fertilizers at the right time and in the correct amounts to avoid over-fertilization.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="activity">
        <h2>4. Monitoring for Diseases</h2>
        <p>Monitoring for diseases is vital to prevent and manage potential threats to tree health. This activity includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Checking for symptoms of common tree diseases, such as leaf spots, wilting, or unusual growths.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying Pests:</strong> Looking for signs of insect infestations that may harm the trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementing Control Measures:</strong> Taking action to treat diseases or pests, which may include organic or chemical treatments.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="activity">
        <h2>5. Harvesting</h2>
        <p>Harvesting involves collecting the mature trees or their products, such as fruits or timber. This activity includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Determining Maturity:</strong> Assessing when trees are ready for harvest based on species and intended use.</li>
            <li><strong>Harvesting Techniques:</strong> Using appropriate methods to minimize damage to the tree and surrounding environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Harvest Management:</strong> Ensuring proper handling and storage of harvested materials to maintain quality.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>By following these activities, individuals and organizations can effectively plant, nurture, and manage trees, contributing to environmental sustainability and resource management.</p>
